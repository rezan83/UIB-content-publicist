## Exercise: Beyonce's Publicist

**Instructions**:

Beyonce's publicist hired you to create a social media link list for Beyonce herself! Your faithful designer has quickly created these little social media icons for you and put them online. All you need to do now is create a series of icons that link to all of Beyonce's social media profiles.

1. Use the list of resources in the HTML file to create an unordered list of image links that contains a link to each of the social media profiles. Each link should open in a new tab.

2. Add a hover tooltip to each of the links with Beyonce's username on each of the social media platforms.

3. Make sure that there are no points before the list items.
